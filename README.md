## 🧠 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SanjanaPulli/Image-Classification-using-Cat-Dog.git
    cd Image-Classification-using-Cat-Dog
    ```

2. Open the notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Cat dog.ipynb"
    ```

3. Run all the cells.

## 📊 Model Summary

The model is a simple CNN designed for binary classification of cat and dog images. It uses convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers followed by a sigmoid activation for binary output.
